This is a project I am working on currently albeit not much as my day job is working me 50 hours a week or more right now. The intent of this app is to allow you to track different locations you have been to such as states in the USA or country in the world. A few things I would like to add once I have an MVP running would to be able to allow you to have a leader board or compare with other users to see where you compare with others.
